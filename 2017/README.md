#### Day -4 (27 Nov 17) ####
Looking forward to this year's challenges. Over the long weekend, I went back and caught up on a bunch of the challenges
from last year that I didn't have a chance to complete. I think that also got me in the right mindset for solving these
challenges over the next few weeks. More updates later...

#### Day 7 ####
This was the first challenge that actually required some thought. The first part was super easy and practically solved
itself. For the second part, I got the answer quickly by manually using the interpreter but I struggled for a little
while to express my process in code. After thinking about it for a little while, I finally came up with a solution that
I think is quite elegant.
